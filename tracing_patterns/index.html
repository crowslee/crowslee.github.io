												<b class="footsteps">Perhaps it is</b> in the very nature of Rome to be read as <b class="footsteps">a palimpsest,</b> as the
							site of perpetual double-exposure.' Throughout the centuries, <b class="footsteps">the modern eye</b>
		finds its vision of the eternal city constantly undermined by-and therefore <b class="footsteps">super-
imposed</b> upon-visual reminders of a monumental past, a past so present that
<b class="footsteps">contemporary sensibility</b> must accommodate rather than attempt to obliterate it.
In November 1786, during his very first days in Rome, Goethe noted that "I find
	it a difficult and melancholy business, I must confess, <b class="footsteps">separating</b> the old Rome
		from the new."2 In the <b class="footsteps">stillness</b> of an autumnal evening two decades earlier, the
					historian Edward Gibbon found in the juxtaposition of the old and the new not
									only the inspiration for, but also the central thesis of what would become his
					magnum opus. Here is how he recalled that moment years later in one of the six
			versions of his memoirs: "In my Journal the place and moment of conception are
		recorded; the fifteenth of October 1764, <b class="footsteps">in</b> the close of evening, as I sat musing in
							the Church of the Zoccolanti or Franciscan fryars, while they were singing Ves-
pers in the Temple of Jupiter on <b class="footsteps">the ruins of</b> the Capitol."3 Gibbons's great historical project was originally "circumscribed to the decay of the City," he notes,
								but it soon extended to the <b class="footsteps">Empire</b> itself<b class="footsteps">.</b>
No one is more closely associated with <b class="footsteps"> this double vision of</b> ancient and
contemporary Rome than Giovanni Battista <b class="footsteps">Piranesi</b>, the Venetian-born printmaker
and sometime architect in whose "strange linear universe," as Marguerite
Yourcenar has nicely phrased it, "all the eighteenth-century <b class="footsteps">angles</b> of incidence
							Richard Wendorf is the Stanford Calderwood Director and Librarian of the Boston Ath-
					enaeum. His most recent book, Sir Joshua Reynolds: The Painter in Society, was the co-
								winner of the Annibel Jenkins Biography Prize. He is currently completing a book on printing history and cultural change in eighteenth-century London.
														and reflection intersect."4 Piranesi's views of Rome had such a profound influ-
																	ence on the cultural imagination of the late eighteenth century, in fact, that the
																			images themselves became yet another superimposition with which the modern
																eye would have to contend. Writing in his Italian Journey, Goethe confessed that
											his first sight <b class="footsteps">of</b> the <b class="footsteps">ruins of</b> Rome had failed to measure up to Piranesi's views of
								them,5 and Horace Walpole urged his contemporaries to "study the <b class="footsteps">sublime dreams</b>
					of Piranesi, who seems to have conceived visions of Rome beyond what it boasted
													even in the meridian of its splendor ... Savage as Salvator Rosa, fierce as Michael
											Angelo, <b class="footsteps">and</b> exuberant as Rubens, <b class="footsteps">h</b>e has imagined scenes that w<b class="footsteps">o</b>uld sta<b class="footsteps">r</b>tle ge-
								ometry, and exhaust the Indies to <b class="footsteps">r</b>ealize. He piles palaces <b class="footsteps">o</b>n b<b class="footsteps">r</b>idge<b class="footsteps">s,</b> and <b class="footsteps">temples</b>
						on palaces, and scales heaven with mountains of edifices. Yet what taste in his
											boldness! What grandeur in his wildness! what labour and thought both in his
									rashness and details!"'
											If we look closely at Piranesi's first published book, the Prima Parte di
												Architteture e Prospettive of 1743, we discover that the aspiring architect, then
														literally scraping together a living as an engraver in Rome, also found his early
																encounter with the ancient city <b class="footsteps">to</b> be a transforming experience, one that signifi-
																cantly shaped his highly personal work as an architect, etcher, and designer. The
															sheer virtuosity of the thirteen etchings in this volume is matched only by Piranesi's
																	learning and bravado. Both of his modern editors, Andrew Robison and John
													Wilton-Ely, agree that it is a truly extraordinary collection of prints, a publication
													that demonstrates how quickly and deeply the young artist had absorbed, and in
											many ways transcended, the graphic and architectural models available to him
							during the early 1740s.7 It is also, I argue, a remarkably proleptic event in Piranesi's
						long and contentious career, revealing not just his growing mastery of subject and
style, but the beginning, as well, of his lifelong attempt to inscribe <b class="footsteps">order-legibil-</b>
<b class="footsteps">ity</b>-on what remained of the Roman past<b class="footsteps">.</b> My focus in this essay is therefore
trained on the fate of writing within these early prints, and-most importantly-
		on the affinity Piranesi sensed so early in his career between the medium of <b class="footsteps">etching</b> 
		and the <b class="footsteps">nature</b> of the ruins he depicted. Beginning with the title page of his
						first publication, Piranesi began to question not just the intelligibility of the past,
							but the stability of his own artistic explorations. Piranesi's oeuvre as a whole
								might be said to manifest a strong confidence that the highest expression of the
								engraver's art could successfully be combined with abundant and fully legible
						writing; a close examination of his first publication suggests, however, that such
									confidence was not easily won.
										In the dedicatory pages of the Prima Parte, Piranesi wro
								speaking ruins have filled my spirit with images that accurate dr
						as those of the immortal Palladio, could never have succeeded in c
								I always kept them before my eyes."8 This would be an extraordinary statement
										even if it did not come from an immodest, twenty-three-year-old arriviste attempt-
									ing-again, literally-<b class="footsteps">to place</b> his mark on what he hoped would become his
					adopted city. Even the Palladian forms with which he was so familiar in his native
			Venice, he argues, cannot convey <b class="footsteps">the images that have filled</b> his spirit, images
													inspired by the ruins he has directly beheld. But of what, precisely, do <b class="footsteps">these</b> 
						<b class="footsteps">eloquent ruins</b> speak? The implicit answer in Piranesi's formulation is a vision of
				monumental Rome <b class="footsteps">in</b> what Walpole called <b class="footsteps">"the meridian of its splendor</b>,<b class="footsteps">"</b> a vi-
								sion imprinted on the sensibility of only the most ambitious, daring, and sensitive
								modern artist.
																Like aspiring architects before him, Piranesi must co
																a form <b class="footsteps">of</b> double vision in which a grand, reconstructive v
																imposed on the surviving fragments of its ancient past. Also
												polemical formulation is the no less important contrast betwe
								<b class="footsteps">monuments</b> of the past and the comparatively unimaginative achievements of
				contemporary Roman architects. (Or, to put his argument in a more precise his-
torical context, as Piranesi himself does elsewhere, the comparatively meager fi-
nancial market for innovative architecture in the Rome of the early 1740s.) "There-
fore," he continues, "having the idea of <b class="footsteps">presenting</b> to <b class="footsteps">the world</b> some of these
images, but not hoping for an architect of these times who could effectively ex-
								ecute some of them . . . there seems to be <b class="footsteps">no recourse</b> than for me or some other
								modern architect to explain his ideas through his drawings<b class="footsteps">.</b>"9
														Explaining<b class="footsteps"> one</b>'s architectural ambitions through one's drawings (or etch-
														ings) is certainly not an unusual situation; it is, if anything, the predicament of the
														aspiring or out-of-work architect of any period. A treatise of the "first part" of
														architecture and perspective appearing in 1743, moreover, could be expected to
																		share close affinities with a publication such as the architect and scene-designer
																		Giuseppe Bibiena's Architteture e Prospettive of 1740 (and the similarit
												tween these two remarkable books have frequently been noted).10 Wha
															usual in Piranesi's first quire of published etchings, however-apart from t
											aggrandizing timbre of the dedication, which was also surely meant to
											his more cautious colleagues-is the imaginative reach of the plates the
															thirteen of them in the first issue of the first edition.
															Most of the plates represent buildings that are in relatively complet
												dition. Some of these buildings are modern in design and appear to be
														by Bibiena: we can see this most clearly in the baroque configuration o
																leria grande di Statue or in the more gothic interior of the Carcere oscura
								which has often been considered a harbinger of the great carceri series lat
						decade." Other "intact" buildings are consciously antique and bear titles such as
				Mausoleo antico, Atrio Dorico, or Sala all'uso degli antichi Romani. In each case,
whether the edifice be ancient or more-or-less modern, the building is imaginary
and the setting is contemporary (note, for instance, that each building is visited or
inhabited by Roman figures of the eighteenth century).
One of the most beautiful of these etchings, the silvery Campidoglio antico
(fig. 2), which clearly anticipates the enormously successful vedute that estab-
						lished Piranesi's reputation later in the decade, was entitled Forma ideale del
						Campidoglio antico in the first issue (but never afterwards). Surely the antecedent
						was unnecessary, for each of the designs was, by definition, <b class="footsteps">an ideal form inspired </b>
						<b class="footsteps">by the past</b>. The buildings Piranesi offered his public were not, strictly speaking,
						replicas or precise reconstructions of other structures, although he would spend
											much of the rest of his career documenting what remained of this Roman legacy.
											What he offered, rather, were contemporary conceptions that, while they may be
											inspired by-and blend in harmoniously with-older edifices, would stake out
											their own claim to monumentality in the Rome of the 1740s. These new but
																		appropriately monumental conceptions have produced the "images" that have
																		filled his "spirit," the "ideas" that can be "explained" only through the medium
													of etching and engraving. Piranesi <b class="footsteps">saw no abrupt break between</b> past and present,
													but rather a salutary continuum-and this is why the ancient stones continue to
																speak to him.
									Two of the original thirteen plates of the Prima Parte, on the other hand,
									depict buildings or scenes that are currently in ruin; these too, it must be empha-
									sized, are also <b class="footsteps">imaginary constructions</b>, not documentary records of existing sites.
			The first of these images is the volume's illustrated title page (fig. 3), which serves
		as the principal focus of this essay. The second is the Rovine d' antichi Edifizj
(fig. 4), arguably the first etching in which Piranesi introduces what will soon become
one of his most characteristic motifs: an arrangement of contemporary <b class="footsteps">figures at-
tempting to make sense of the</b> ancient ruins and <b class="footsteps">inscriptions they have inherited</b>,
prototypes-so <b class="footsteps">to</b> speak-of the Goethes and Gibbons who would inevitably follow.
					It is important that we <b class="footsteps">reconcile</b> (or at least compare) these two images
					of ruins with the preponderance of plates devoted to buildings that are shown to
								be in relatively good repair. The eleven plates depicting <b class="footsteps">rooms, prisons, staircases,</b>
														<b class="footsteps">atria, mausoleums</b>, or bridges that are still intact draw upon ancient and baroque
														sources but translate them into designs for contemporary use (this, at least, <b class="footsteps">is</b>
																Piranesi's conceit). The two plates depicting ruins, on <b class="footsteps">the other hand</b>, are predi-
																			cated on <b class="footsteps">the conception of</b> an ancient building or site that has deteriorated with
																			time. This is essentially <b class="footsteps">a double act</b> of the imagination, for neither the "original"
																					model nor the "surviving" ruin actually existed. All of the plates of the Prima
																				Parte appear to have a documentary flavor, but none so much as the two capricci,
															which stand, paradoxically, <b class="footsteps">twice removed</b> from any possible source.
																		Given Piranesi's explicit aim in his dedicatory text, the inclusion of any
																plates devoted to ruins within the Prima Parte is, at first glance, an odd choice for
																an aspiring architect to make. The juxtaposition of crumbling and intact build-
										ings certainly demonstrates the young artist's virtuosity and antiquarian interests,
							but it does so with more bravura than practicality. When Piranesi issued revised

							sets of the prints later in the decade, moreover, he chose to introduce only two
		additional prints of intact buildings (the Gruppo di Colonne and the Tempio
		antico) whereas he <b class="footsteps">devoted</b> three new etchings <b class="footsteps">to</b> buildings in ruin: Vestiggi d'
antichi Edificj, Ara antica, and the Camera sepolcrale. He also continued to re-
						vise the Rovine d' antichi Edifizj, issuing it in <b class="footsteps">numerous</b> states over the years as
									Ruine di Sepolcro antico. These additional plates either closely anticipate or are
									coterminous with Piranesi's execution of his early vedute, the first states of his
			carceri, and the grotteschi, the prints by which he was-and still remains-best
																								known. They suggest, moreover, that his increasingly intense focus on the <b class="footsteps">depiction of ruins</b> was particularly suited to the etching process, even when it was
																					augmented by engraving, drypoint, and scraping, as it often was in these early
																					plates.12 The process of etching, in which the artist draws with a stylus on the
																			varnished surface of the copperplate (rather than working with an engraving burin
																into the copper itself), allows the acid to produce <b class="footsteps">soft, delicate, spidery</b>, even
																painterly effects with the printer's ink.
													Some of this heightened mastery of technique can be seen in the often
													subtle changes Piranesi introduced in the second state of the title page at the end
													of 1743 or beginning of 1744 (fig. 5). Except for the obvious change in the dedi-
															catory title itself, the two plates look remarkably alike: there are no alterations in
															the principal elements of the original title plate, only microscopic changes in the
																	way in which Piranesi reworks or introduces objects with a delicate, almost feather-
																	like technique. Andrew Robison points in particular to the deft and sophisticated
													way in which the foliage at the bottom center of the plate is executed in the
													revised state.13 But much of the copperplate has actually been carefully reworked,
											including the marble tablet on which the title and dedication are carved.
											Piranesi's conception of the title page as a collection of imaginary Roman
											antiquities-some in ruin, some more or less preserved, as in the veduta ideata of
											Panini14 -is an intriguing conceit, visually embodying what it verbally proclaims,
									and thus providing a symbolic introduction to the bifurcated series of plates that
follows. This unusual strategy means, however, that the title itself cannot stand at
center stage. Consigned to the right-hand side of the print, placed at a recess in
the middle distance, and inscribed on a reclining slab of <b class="footsteps">partially overgrown</b> marble,
Piranesi's title imposes at least a modest amount of visual exercise on the part of
			the reader. This labor increases slightly as one examines the revised second state,
										where the entire marble tablet-which reminds us, of course, of the copperplate
										on which the entire image has been etched-has been burnished clean an
													reworked.15 Piranesi augments his dedication to his mentor, the builder
													noisseur Nicola Giobbe, by including information about his own recent
													to an artistic society, the Arcadi, that placed particular value on the symbolic
																<b class="footsteps">forms</b> that <b class="footsteps">were emerging</b> in these capricci.16 But the major change here is not so
																much in the expansion of the text as in the style of the inscription, which has
																modulated <b class="footsteps">from the</b> large, <b class="footsteps">dark</b>, deeply "chiseled" lettering of the original plate
																to the comparatively light, shallow, and more evenly "carved" lettering of the
													revised plate a few months later.
															I place "chiseled" and "carved" in quotation marks because both prints
																		are etchings that represent marble which has been incised. The visual style of the
															first inscription, however, is that of the engraver, whereas the marble tablet of the
												revised plate begins to suggest the softness of the entire etching. This stylistic
												development can be seen most fully by the time the plate has reached its fourth
										state (the sixth issue of the first edition) in 1748, five years after its first publica-
										tion. (There are minor alterations in the third state, but these are-to borrow a
												distinction from textual editing-accidental rather than substantive.) Piranesi's
									final rendering of the title page (fig. 6), which would remain intact throughout his
									lifetime, is dramatically different in almost every way from its two predecessors-
									in its style, its text, and even its subject-and it therefore provides us with a
remarkable opportunity to chart the growth of the artist during some of the ear-
liest moments of his career.
The most pervasive change <b class="footsteps">to be found</b> in this final version of Piranesi's
title page lies <b class="footsteps">in the</b> artist's handling of light. The <b class="footsteps">play between</b> the dark obelisk
on the left side of the print and the more lightly modeled elements on the right
began to appear in <b class="footsteps">the second state,</b> but by the fourth state the contrast in values
						has deepened into dramatic chiaroscuro. The temple in the far distance (at the top
												of the plate) and the marble tablet are now the focus of intense and radiant light,
												and <b class="footsteps">this carefully controlled experiment</b> in tonality reinforces the feathery effects
												of the etching process. <b class="footsteps">In</b> order to carry out such pervasive changes, Piranesi has
														had to burnish clean and then once again etch the upper two-thirds of the copper-
																plate (virtually everything except the obelisk on the left and the various fragments
												in the lower right of the print). In doing so, he has shrouded the temple in the
												background in <b class="footsteps">hazy mist,</b> turned the large, decorated urn near the center of the
												plate into a ruin, <b class="footsteps">changed (yet again)</b> the style and text of the inscription, covered
										the bottom of it <b class="footsteps">in heavy fog</b>, and (in his most theatrical gesture) introduced
										human figures throughout the composition. These <b class="footsteps">spidery characters</b> made their
								original appearance in the Rovine d' antichi Edifizj of the first issue (fig. 4); five
								years later we find them positioned <b class="footsteps">throughout</b> the image-in the temple, in the
								middle ground, atop the urn, and directly in front of the inscription itself.
								Taken as a whole, <b class="footsteps">this heavily reworked</b> and reconceptualized image be-
						gins to suggest the complexities of Piranesi's greatest work, particularly his han-
								dling of "ruins already fifteen hundred years old," as Yourcenar describes them in
		her exploration of what she calls the "dark brain" of Piranesi: "broken stone and
		crumbling brick; the collapsing vault that welcomes light's intrusion; the tunnel
of dark rooms opening in the distance on daylight streaming through a broken
wall; the overhanging plinth, suspended on the brink of its collapse, the <b class="footsteps">great
broken rhythm</b> of aqueducts and colonnades; temples and basilicas lying open as
			though <b class="footsteps">turned inside out</b> by the depredations of time and of man, <b class="footsteps">so that the</b>
			<b class="footsteps">interior has now become</b> a kind of <b class="footsteps">exterior, everywhere invaded by</b> space like a
					ship by water."17 It is this world, <b class="footsteps">a world of fragmentation</b> and disrupted vision,
								that Piranesi moves so decisively towards in this complex image, which both pro-
											claims the subject of the plates to follow and simultaneously places its title under
													erasure<b class="footsteps">.</b> What could have led Piranesi to have taken such an extraordinary step?
													The nominal reason for <b class="footsteps">the rearticulation</b> of the title page <b class="footsteps">was</b> surely the
											death of Nicola Giobbe in October 1748.18 Giobbe had shared his collection of
											books and prints with the young artist and had introduced him to Salvi and
								Vanvitelli, Rome's most <b class="footsteps">successful</b> architects <b class="footsteps">at the beginning</b> of the decade. <b class="footsteps">It</b>
										<b class="footsteps">was</b> therefore both natural and expedient for Piranesi to dedicate his first book to
							his first patron, trusting that further support and a possible commission would
					follow, and acknowledging his debt to Giobbe's instruction. "You not only showed
					me piece by piece all of the most singular beauties of this <b class="footsteps">kind</b>, ancient and <b class="footsteps">modern</b> that can be found in Rome," he wrote in his dedicatory letter at the end of the
			volume, "<b class="footsteps">but</b> you have shown with the example of your excellent drawings how
			one can make praiseworthy use of <b class="footsteps">the</b> discoveries of our great predecessors in
			new <b class="footsteps">forms</b>."19 Following Giobbe's death, however, the dedicatory portion of the
			title page <b class="footsteps">disappeared, concealed in the whirling mist</b> and <b class="footsteps">scrutinized in vain</b> by
			the gesticulating figures.
				Years later, following a bitter dispute with Lord Charlemont, Piranesi
would once again remove a dedicatory inscription from the title page of one of his
publications (the Antichit Romane of 1756).20 There is no documentary evi-
						dence, however, to suggest that Piranesi and Giobbe had a falling out, or <b class="footsteps">that</b>
						Piranesi had been seriously disappointed in his expectations. As he made clear in
									his dedicatory letter, after all, he planned to forsake Rome immediately following
									the publication of this volume.21 Piranesi therefore had several possible choices
											before him: he could omit a dedicatee and move the inscription to the center of
															the tablet, he could change the dedication in order to memorialize Giobbe, or he
															could change the dedicatee altogether, hoping to engage the patronage of some-
																	one who would advance his work. Instead, he dropped the dedicatory letter at the
														end of the book but retained the space devoted to the original dedicatory lines
														near the bottom of the tablet, replacing the original inscription (<b class="footsteps">which had been</b>
										<b class="footsteps">completely burnished away</b>) with a swirl of clouds and thereby drawing attention
										to what was no longer there<b class="footsteps">.</b>
				This would appear to be an extreme example of visual playfulness and/or
obscurantism, made all the more apparent by the gesturing figure in the center of
the plate, who draws his companion's attention to the words that can no longer
be seen. One legible trace does actually remain, however, and it is to this single
letter- a fragile capital "E" directly to the left of the ram's head (fig. 7)-rather
					than to the clouds themselves that Piranesi's figure points. The letter has been
					painstakingly added to this final version of the plate rather than simply salvaged
							from the second and third states. It shares a silvery softness with the rest of the
												newly inscribed letters, which are executed in such an unusually free manner that
										two of the capital "N"s are actually reversed.22 In a moment, even the final letter
										of Giobbe's name will disappear. And thus what we witness here is not simply an
								acknowledgment of the mysterious language of these speaking ruins, but also <b class="footsteps">a</b>
														<b class="footsteps">reenactment</b> of the temporal and physical forces <b class="footsteps">that engender ruin</b> in the first
														place. Even the luxuriant vegetation reminds us of the indifference of the natural
											world and its continuing role as a destructive agent.
																We also witness, in this proleptic image, the birth of Piranesi's lifelong
																fascination with the physical properties of language. The Prima Parte opens with
																a title that is theatrically embedded in what would otherwise be an illustrated
																																			and fourth times in 1747 and 1748, the ordinary woodcut chosen for the initial
																	letter "S" of the dedication had been replaced by an elegant, undulating, <b class="footsteps">historiated</b>
																	letter of Piranesi's own design. And in the three successive title pages we see not
																				just the etcher's growing mastery of his medium, but also his burgeoning interest
																				in the nature of ancient inscriptions. This fascination with the language of monu-
																				ments would eventually lead to the publication of his Lapides Capitolini in 1761
frontispiece, and the book closes not with a visual flourish but with a written,
																highly polemical dedication. By the time this slim volume was issued for the third
																					and to the development of what Armando Petrucci has characterized as the free-
																					dom and ingenuity of the littera piranesiana. In Petrucci's view, Piranesi's learned
																					and muscular lettering <b class="footsteps">embodies</b> "the monumental written city," and it does so
																					just as the images of imposing buildings first conceptualized in the Prima Parte
																		do, by moving beyond an accurate <b class="footsteps">reconstruction</b> of the <b class="footsteps">past</b> to <b class="footsteps">"a global idealization"</b> of what imperial Rome had once been.23
																		In the early prints <b class="footsteps">devoted to ruins</b>, however, writing would take a differ-
																		ent turn. As early as the Rovine d' antichi Edifizj of the first issue in 1743 (fig. 4)
															we discover-as Piranesi's figures do-a pervasive threat to the very intelligibility
															of the past. In the one surviving inscription in this early plate we can make out the
															imperial "SPQR," but the rest of the lettering has almost been worn smooth. In
															the second and third states of this etching (1748 and afterwards), a third pointing
				figure has been added, but the inscription itself has virtually disappeared; the
				letters "SPQR" have been burnished out, and only a few disjointed letters remain.
In the title page, as we have seen, the lettering of the inscription has modulated
with each revision towards a lighter, less heavily carved style of "engraving." By
the time Piranesi has reached his final (and most sophisticated) version in 1748,
moreover, writing itself has begun to disappear.
With the diminution of language comes the simultaneous appearance of
human figures, mute spectators attempting to make sense of the inscription that
disappears before their very eyes. Human presence, in other words, is cotermi-
nous with <b class="footsteps"> linguistic absence or dissolution.</b> Or, to put it the other way round, the
<b class="footsteps"> disappearance of language, </b>of the dedicatory lines devoted to Nicola Giobbe-as
time, <b class="footsteps">in the guise of mist or cloud, works its effects</b> on marble and the writing
inscribed <b class="footsteps">upon it-this disappearance of </b>a full text points to the need for inter-
pretive gestures. <b class="footsteps">The figures who people this plate are not</b> the faintly threatening
beggars of the urban vedute,24 but rather the embodiment of <b class="footsteps">"gesticulating hu-
manity"</b> (in Wilton-Ely's useful phrase),25 symbolic characters that literally point
to Piranesi's central concerns. They remind us of Alberti's preference for "some-
one who admonishes and points out to us what is happening [in an istoria]; or
beckons with his hand to see; . . . or shows some danger or marvellous thing
there; or invites us to weep or to laugh together with them."26 They therefore
exercise what Claude Gandelman has called the "gesture of demonstration," a
perlocutionary act in which enlightenment successors to the demonstrator of early
Renaissance religious painting <b class="footsteps">force us to follow the vector of their gaze</b> and thus
					confront <b class="footsteps">the puzzle of the fragmented inscription ourselves</b>.27
					<b class="footsteps">The figure with the extended arm</b> gestures towards Piranesi's original,
					dedicatory gesture. What he <b class="footsteps">points to</b>, however, is almost entirely obscured by the
																	natural forces <b class="footsteps">that</b> swirl before him. Because he and his companion cannot read-
																				or <b class="footsteps">can no longer</b> read-beneath the swirling mist, his gesture might <b class="footsteps">be paraphrased</b>
																											as "Giobbe is no more." And here we are faced with another paradox, for with
																											<b class="footsteps">the absence</b> or disappearance <b class="footsteps">of language comes the origin of narrative</b>: a tale of
																								human decay, of the death of someone who had educated and encouraged Piranesi
																								during his formative years, and a narrative of hermeneutic engagement as <b class="footsteps">we</b>
																									<b class="footsteps">explore what</b> the artist clearly wished to emphasize as missing or incomplete.
																													Piranesi's fascination with the instability of the inscription <b class="footsteps">is</b> consistent
																													with a thematic tendency in European epigraphy that was at least a century old
																								by the early 1740s. Petrucci has summarized this development as a "tendency to
																								obscure the meaning of the graphic sign, to treat it as elusive, <b class="footsteps">ambiguous</b>, and
																																<b class="footsteps">difficult</b> to decipher, thereby portraying monumental writing as something re-
																											mote, fascinating, and pompous, decipherable only through conscious and strenu-
																											ous effort."28 He describes seventeenth-century images in which "the act of deci-
																								phering has become the central focus of the scene," and his depiction of one
																								painting in particular, the second version of Poussin's Et in Arcadia Ego (fig. 8),
																				also suggests the focus of both Piranesi's title page and the Rovine d' antichi
																								Edifizj: "The figures gathered round are pointing out the inscription to each other
																								FIGURE 8. Nicolas Poussin, Et in Arcadia Ego (The Arcadian Shepherds), painting (second version,
																			1635). By permission of the Musee du Louvre.
																			and seem to be engaged in an antiquarian discussion about its meaning, but as far
																as the viewer of the painting is concerned, the inscription is quite <b class="footsteps">illegible.</b>"29
																Petrucci's final point is debatable, but it is clear that-like Louis Marin
																				and W. J. T. Mitchell-he sees the focus of Poussin's painting as the scene of
																				interpretation. "The event here," Marin argues, "is the story of enunciation or of
								representation. What is represented is the very process of representation."30 For
								Mitchell, the painting is "a representation of a representation"; it is a metapicture
				in which we glimpse the stages in "a process of encounter, apprehension, puzzle-
ment, and discussion."31 And what is true of Poussin in his mature work is surely
worth remarking of Piranesi in his very earliest, where a self-conscious focus on
the process of interpretation serves as the initial gesture of his volume.
								For Piranesi, as for his precursors, the partial obliteration of the sign
								makes it loom even larger, with the pentimenti of the inscriptions suggesting both
								the fragile <b class="footsteps">and incomplete</b> remains of antiquity and the absolute certainty of human
											decay. These two corollaries are almost always found together, as in <b class="footsteps">the superfluous</b> reminder Diderot addressed to Hubert Robert, the ultimate ruiniste: "Mon-
																																sieur Robert, don't you know why ruins give such pleasure, independent of the
																																variety of accidents they reveal? I will tell you. . . . Everything dissolves, every-
																													thing perishes, everything passes; only the world remains, only time endures . ..
																					What is my ephemeral existence compared to crumbling stone? . . . I see the
																		marble of tombs crumble into powder and I don't want to die!"32 Et in Arcadia
																		ego: each of Piranesi's modern commentators has had to confront the moral
																							sententia implicitly embedded in his work. The responses range from Nicholas
																							Penny's focus on Piranesi's "didacticism" ("He found in his ruins the evidence of
																							their original strength and so enhances our awareness of the forces needed to
															defeat such buildings")33 to Robert Moore's claim that Piranesi is "a great tragic
															artist": "Piranesi, it seems to me, makes us feel the precariousness of civilization.
																			The despoiled tombs, the naked and decaying stonework stripped of its marble,
																			haunted by cadaverous beggars, stand witness to the grim idea that obsessed Pope
																			in the last Dunciad."34 Only Marguerite Yourcenar has responded with ambiva-
																							lence to the <b class="footsteps">human element in these speaking ruins</b>. Characterizing Piranesi as
																							"the interpreter and virtually the inventor of Rome's tragic beauty,"35 she none-
																			theless interprets his work as a meditation on the life and death of forms. His
				ruins do not "release a discourse on the grandeur and decadence of empires and
the instability of human affairs, but rather a meditation on the duration or the
					slow erosion of things, on the opaque identity of the block continuing, within the
												monument, its long existence of stone as stone."36 The human figures introduced
												into these images serve no thematic or ironic function, she argues; they simply
																serve to accentuate the height of the vaults and the depth of the perspective.37
																This is certainly not the role of the human figures in the pages of the
																Prima Parte, where they serve as hermeneutic markers pointing-across the <b class="footsteps">ob-</b>
																					<b class="footsteps">scuring mist</b> that <b class="footsteps">hides</b> virtually any trace of Giobbe from us-to human as well
																					as architectural degradation. Having discovered <b class="footsteps">the natural affinity between</b> the
																					stylistic qualities of etched images (particularly their comparative softness of line)
																	and the physical textures of the ruins they represent, Piranesi was embarked-
												despite his intentions-on a career as an etcher as well as a designer, as a vedutista
																			and ruiniste as well as a practicing architect, in the steps of Ricci and Vasi as well
																			as Palladio.38 Each image he produced, moreover, represents <b class="footsteps">a double ruin:</b> not
																						through the traditional topos linking cultural and human decay (although that
																						seems to be indisputably true of so many of these images), but rather in the sense
																						that the process of physical deterioration we witness in his ruins is analogous to
																											the etching process itself, which proceeds by immersing the varnished and in-
																												scribed copperplate in a bath of acid, which then bites into the copper surface the
																												artist has exposed.
																							The role of acid in the printing process has often been associated with the
																							corrosive, biting properties of visual satire, and Piranesi's own technique has been
																							likened to the method of autopsy. He remains, in Hyatt Mayor's view, "the most
									dramatic dissector of ruins": he "went at Rome's weedy lumps of ruin like an
													anatomist at a cadaver, stripping, sectioning, sawing until he had established the
													structure in all its layers and functions.""39 In Barbara Stafford's more recent anal-
													ogy, Piranesi "applied surgical procedures taken, I believe, from medical illustra-
														tions, <b class="footsteps">to turn the still-living fabric</b> of architecture inside out."40 These metaphori-
										cal descriptions would work better, perhaps, if Piranesi had been an engraver,
										literally slicing, cutting, incising <b class="footsteps">beneath</b> the surface of his plate. Because he chose
										to work as an etcher, however, the process that enabled him to unearth <b class="footsteps">the past</b>
					was corrosive itself-not merely an antidote to loss, but a reenactment of loss<b class="footsteps">.</b>
											Much of the softness we value in etchings, after all, is actually produced by the
											infiltration of acid beneath the varnish that has been applied to the copperplate.
															Like the marble tablet of his revised title page, Piranesi's copperplates
															were also vulnerable to the depredations of time. A plate that has been etched is
																						much less durable than one that has been engraved, and the minor, "accidental"
																		changes that Piranesi introduces into some of his prints may be aesthetically jus-
																							tified, but <b class="footsteps">they</b> also <b class="footsteps">betray</b> the fact that the copperplate-like <b class="footsteps">the ruinous</b> surfaces
																							it represents-is itself prey to natural forces. The <b class="footsteps">mechanical reproduction</b> of the
																							etched image, <b class="footsteps">in which copy follows copy and</b> issue follows issue, eventually works
																its own ruinous effects on a copperplate that must be reworked in order to offset
																the graphic loss through printing. Piranesi thought that he could print an extraor-
																				dinary number of prints-as many as 4,000-from each copperplate, a figure
																				much higher than that of his contemporaries.41 But the "astonishing resistance"
																				of his plates (as Yourcenar puts it) must be carefully predicated on a style of
																					etching that is relatively linear, forsaking the heavy crosshatching that tends to
																					gather ink.42 Piranesi would embrace the <b class="footsteps">simplicity</b> of this technique in his revi-
																															sion of the plates of the Prima Parte until the 1770s, when he would finally turn
																									to a bolder, more accentuated style in which a sharp contrast between darks and
																									lights <b class="footsteps">replaced</b> the <b class="footsteps">subtle modulations</b> of his earlier manner.43
																													Having begun its life as an "oeuvre heteroclite,"44 the Prima Parte had,
																							by the 1770s, long lost its own integrity as a codex<b class="footsteps">.</b> <b class="footsteps">Having prefigured</b> so many of
																							Piranesi's later preoccupations-in subject, style, polemical edge, and even (as I
																		have argued here) its self-conscious gesturing to its own graphic and cultural
																						<b class="footsteps">instability</b>-this slim volume was soon (and appropriately) absorbed into the grow-
												ing <b class="footsteps">corpus</b> of his work, thereby revealing his extraordinary habits of revision and
												<b class="footsteps">cross-fertilization</b>. The Prima Parte ultimately figures not just the individual cop-

	The dictionary defines nostalgia as "homesickness" or <b class="footsteps">a</b> "<b class="footsteps">longing for something far</b>
	<b class="footsteps">away</b> or long ago."1 The word is made up of the Greek nostos = home and algos =
				pain. Nostalgia's primary meaning has to do with the irreversibility of time: <b class="footsteps">some</b>
				<b class="footsteps">thing</b> in the past is <b class="footsteps">no longer accessible.</b> Since the European seventeenth century,
						with the emergence of <b class="footsteps">a new sense of temporality</b> increasingly characterized by
									the radical asymmetries of past, present, and future, nostalgia as <b class="footsteps">a longing for a lost</b>
											<b class="footsteps">past</b> has developed into the modern disease per se.2 This predominantly negative
											coding of nostalgia within modernity is easily explained: nostalgia counteracts,
						even undermines linear notions of progress, whether they are framed dialectically
								as philosophy of history or sociologically and economically as modernization. But
				nostalgic longing for a past is always also a longing for another place. Nostalgia can
				be a utopia in reverse. Temporality and spatiality are necessarily linked in nostalgic
				desire. The architectural ruin is an example of the <b class="footsteps">indissoluble</b> combination of
spatial and temporal desires that trigger nostalgia. <b class="footsteps">In the body of the ruin</b> the past
is both present in <b class="footsteps">its residues</b> and yet no longer accessible, making the ruin an
especially powerful <b class="footsteps">trigger</b> for nostalgia.
		The cult of ruins has accompanied Western modernity in <b class="footsteps">waves</b> since the eigh
				teenth century. But <b class="footsteps">over</b> the past decade and a half, a strange obsession with ruins	
has developed in the countries of <b class="footsteps">the northern transatlantic</b> as part of a much
								broader discourse about memory and trauma, genocide and war. This contempo
							rary obsession with ruins hides <b class="footsteps">a nostalgia for an earlier age that had not yet lost</b>
									<b class="footsteps">its power</b> to imagine other futures. <b class="footsteps">At stake is a</b> nostalgia for <b class="footsteps">modernity that dare</b>
							<b class="footsteps">not speak its name</b> after acknowledging the catastrophes of the twentieth century
									and the lingering injuries of inner and outer colonization. <b class="footsteps">Yet this nostalgia</b>
													<b class="footsteps">persists</b>, straining for something lost with the ending of an earlier form of moder
													nity. <b class="footsteps">The cipher</b> for this nostalgia is the ruin.
											The Ruin Craze
											At a time when the <b class="footsteps">promises</b> of the modern age lie <b class="footsteps">shattered</b> like so many ruins,
								when we speak with increasing frequency both literally and metaphorically of the
							ruins of modernity, a key question arises for cultural <b class="footsteps">history:</b> What shapes our
									<b class="footsteps">imaginary</b> of ruins in the early twenty-first century, and how has it developed his
											torically? How can we speak of a nostalgia for ruins as we remember the bombed
																out cities of World War II (Rotterdam and Coventry, Hamburg and Dresden,
																Warsaw, Stalingrad, and Leningrad). Bombings, after all, are not about producing
																						<b class="footsteps">ruins</b>. They <b class="footsteps">produce rubble</b>. But then the market has recently been saturated with
																								stunning picture books and films (documentary and fictional; e.g., The Downfall,
																								2004) of the ruins of World War II. In them, rubble is indeed <b class="footsteps">transformed</b>, even	
																aestheticized, into ruin.
																Nostalgia is at stake in the northern transatlantic when one looks at the <b class="footsteps">decaying</b>
											residues of the industrial age and its shrinking cities in the <b class="footsteps">industrial heartlands</b>
														in Europe, the former Soviet Union, <b class="footsteps">the United States, and elsewhere</b>: abandoned
									auto factories in Detroit; the monstrous blast furnaces of former steelworks in the												Ruhr, now incorporated into public parks; the gigantic coal-steel conglomerates in
														Eastern Europe surrounded by ghost towns, ciphers of the end of socialism; and so
														on. Such ruins and their representation in picture books, films, and exhibits are <b class="footsteps">a</b>
							<b class="footsteps">sign</b> of the nostalgia for the monuments of an industrial architecture of a past age
							that was tied to a public culture of industrial labor and its political organization.
										We are nostalgic <b class="footsteps">for the ruins</b> of modernity because they still seem to hold a promise
										<b class="footsteps">that</b> has <b class="footsteps">vanished</b> from our own age: the promise of an alternative future. Such nos
				talgia for the ruins of the modern can be called reflective in Svetlana Boym's sense
				and refutes historian Charles Maier's pithy pronouncement that nostalgia is to
				memory <b class="footsteps">like kitsch</b> is to art.3 "Reflective nostalgia cherishes shattered fragments
							of memory and temporalizes space.... [It] reveals that longing and critical thinking
			are not opposed to one another, as affective memories do not absolve one from
			compassion, judgment or critical reflection."4
			The present fascination with industrial ruins raises other questions. To what
extent is the contemporary love affair with ruins <b class="footsteps">in the</b><b class="footsteps"> sea</b> countries of the northern
transatlantic still energized by an earlier imagination that had fastened on to the
ruins of classical antiquity? And what is the relation <b class="footsteps">of</b> this imaginary of ruins to
			the obsession with <b class="footsteps">urban preservation, remakes,</b> and <b class="footsteps">retrofashions</b>, all of which
			seem to express a fear or denial of the ruination by time? Our imaginary of ruins can
			be read as a palimpsest of multiple historical events and representations, and the
			intense concern with ruins is a subset of the current <b class="footsteps">privileging</b> of <b class="footsteps">memory</b> and
						trauma both inside and outside the academy.
										Given this overdetermination in the way we imagine and conceptualize ruins,
													can something like an "authentic" ruin of modernity be the subject of reflective
										nostalgia? An answer can be found in the imaginary of ruins that developed in the
								eighteenth century's querelle des anciens et des modernes and was carried forth
								in romanticism and privileged in the nineteenth-century search for national origins,
						<b class="footsteps">only to end up in the ruin tourism of</b> the present. The work of Giovanni Battista
										Piranesi stands as one of the most radical articulations of the ruin problematic
										within modernity rather than after it. My interest in Piranesi and his ruins may
												well be itself<b class="footsteps"> nostalgic-nostalgic</b>, that is, for a secular modernity that had a deep
												understanding of the ravages of time and the potential of the future, the destruc
												tiveness of domination and the tragic shortcomings of the present; an understanding
										of modernity that-from Piranesi and the <b class="footsteps">romantics</b> to Baudelaire, the historical
												<b class="footsteps">avant-garde</b>, and <b class="footsteps">beyond-resulted</b> in emphatic forms of critique, commitment,
																and compelling artistic expression. Here, as in any form of nostalgia, it is difficult
																to walk the line between <b class="footsteps">sentimental lament</b> over a loss and the critical reclaiming
																of a past for the purposes of <b class="footsteps">constructing</b> alternative futures. But Piranesi may have
														lessons for us as we reflect upon the loss of an earlier modernity and its visions of
														alternative futures.
														My interest in <b class="footsteps">coupling</b> the abstract concept of authenticity with the <b class="footsteps">concrete</b>
																ness of ruins and their imaginary is based on the idea that both the ruin in its
																<b class="footsteps">emphatic</b> sense and the notion of the <b class="footsteps">authentic</b> are central topoi of modernity itself
																			rather than simply concerns of the late twentieth century. Modernity as ruin was a
													topos well before the twentieth century and most certainly before postmodernism.
													The authentic ruin is not to be understood as some ontological essence of ruins but
										as a significant conceptual and architectural constellation that points to moments
						of decay, <b class="footsteps">falling apart</b>, and ruination already present in the beginnings of moder
						nity in the eighteenth century. Just as the imaginary of ruins was created in early
						modernity rather than being modernity's end product, the notion of authenticity
									is a thoroughly historical concept produced, like nostalgia itself, by modernity
									rather than referring to an atemporal transcendent essence or to some premodern
			state of grace. Tied in literature and art to eighteenth-century notions of author
			ship, genius, originality, selfhood, <b class="footsteps">uniqueness</b>, and subjectivity, the idea of authen
			ticity <b class="footsteps">accumulated desires</b> and intensities the more it was threatened by alienation,
			inauthenticity, and reproducibility during the course of modernization. As a term in
that broader semantic field, authenticity had its heyday in the second half of the
twentieth century together with the boom in nostalgias of all kinds, and it has its
currency today in retro-authenticity, authentic remakes, and the Web's "authen
ticity consulting," all <b class="footsteps">phenomena</b> which implicitly deny what they claim to be. At
the same time, authenticity has fallen on hard times in intellectual discourse. From
					Adorno to Derrida authenticity has been disparaged as ideology or metaphysics, tied to
					a jargon of Eigentlichkeit, pseudo-individualization, and delusions of self-presence.
					Nevertheless, I am not ready to abandon the concept altogether, and I take comfort
									in the fact that even Adorno, one of the most radical critics of a specific post-1945
														form of Eigentlichkeit, still spoke of the authenticity of modernist art as radical
														<b class="footsteps">negation</b>. His is a notion of the authentic aware of its own historicity. Similarly, I
														<b class="footsteps">will locate</b> <b class="footsteps">the "authentic ruin"</b> of modernity in the eighteenth century, and <b class="footsteps">I will</b>
																suggest that this earlier imaginary of ruins still <b class="footsteps">haunt</b>s our discourse about the ruins
																			of modernity in general. At the same time, I acknowledge that <b class="footsteps">the twentieth century</b>
																			has produced a very different imaginary of <b class="footsteps">ruin</b>s that has made that earlier authentic
																									ruin obsolete. Even genuine ("echt" rather than authentic) ruins have <b class="footsteps">metamorphosed</b>.
																									The element of <b class="footsteps">decay</b>, erosion, and a return to nature so central to eighteenth
																					century ruins and <b class="footsteps">their nostalgic lure</b> is eliminated when Roman ruins are sanitized
																and <b class="footsteps">used as mise en scene</b> for open-air opera performances (Terme di Caracalla in
											Rome); when medieval castle ruins or dilapidated estates from later centuries are
											restored <b class="footsteps">to yield conference sites, hotels,</b> or <b class="footsteps">vacation rentals</b> (the Paradores of Spain,
							the Landmark Trust in the United Kingdom); when <b class="footsteps">industrial ruins</b> are <b class="footsteps">made over</b>
									into cultural centers; or when a museum like the Tate Modern installs <b class="footsteps">itself</b> in a
									decommissioned power plant on the south bank of the Thames. Authenticity seems
							<b class="footsteps">to have become part</b> <b class="footsteps">of</b> museal preservation and restoration, a fact that can only
					increase <b class="footsteps">nostalgia</b>.
					"Authentic ruins," as they still existed in the eighteenth and nineteenth cen
					turies, seem no longer to have a place in late capitalism's commodity and memory
					culture. As commodities, things in general don't age well. They become obsolete,
					are thrown out or recycled. Buildings are torn down or restored. The chance for
things to age and to become ruin has diminished in the age of turbo capitalism,
				ironically in step with the continuing rise in the average age of the populace. The
				ruin of the twenty-first century is either <b class="footsteps">detritus</b> or restored age. In the latter case,
									real age has been eliminated by a reverse face-lifting. <b class="footsteps">The new is made to look old</b>
									rather than <b class="footsteps">the old made to look young</b>. Repro- and retrofashions make it increas
									ingly hard to recognize that which is genuinely old in this culture of preservation
													and restoration. The German writer and filmmaker Alexander Kluge once spoke
													tellingly of "the attack of the present on the rest of time."5
																		Authenticity and Nostalgia
																		If in the late twentieth century, as Lyotard has claimed, architecture and philosophy
																		lay in ruins, leaving us with only the option of a "writing of the ruins" as a kind of
																		micrology, then the question arises whether the whole tradition of modernist thought
																	all the way into postmodernism isn't overshadowed by <b class="footsteps">a catastrophic imagination </b>
																	and an imaginary of ruins that has <b class="footsteps">accompanied</b> the trajectory of modernity since
													the eighteenth century.6 Architecture in decay or a state of destruction seems to be
															an indispensable topos for this tradition. Real ruins of different kinds function as
						<b class="footsteps">projective screens</b> for modernity's articulation of asynchronous temporalities and
				for its fear of and obsession with the passing of time.7 If, as Benjamin said, allegory
				in the realm of thought corresponds to the ruin in the realm of things, then this
				implies a production principle of modern art, literature, and architecture that is <b class="footsteps">a priori</b> 
				directed toward the ruinous.8 For Adorno, in analogous fashion, the most
authentic works of modernity are those that are objectively and formally deter
							mined by the ruinous state of the present. The architectural ruin <b class="footsteps">seems to hover in</b>
							<b class="footsteps">the background of</b> an aesthetic imagination that privileges <b class="footsteps">fragment</b> and aphorism,
							collage and montage, freedom from <b class="footsteps">ornament and reduction</b> of the material. Perhaps
										this is the secret classicism of modernism that, however different from eighteenth
										century classicism in its coding of temporality and space, is still predicated on an
													imaginary of ruins. Classicism in Winckelmann and Goethe's times constituted
													itself through the ruins of antiquity, but it aimed at the <b class="footsteps">totality of</b> style rather than
										privileging <b class="footsteps">montage</b>, dispersion, and fragmentariness as modernism would later
										do. One doesn't have to accept a metaphysics of history in order to see the field of
							classical modernism as a fascinating and <b class="footsteps">oscillating</b> landscape of ruins left from a
												<b class="footsteps">failed attempt</b> to create an alternative kind of totality that in architecture went
												<b class="footsteps">under the name of</b> the International Style.
												As a product of modernity rather than a phenomenon from a deep premodern
																past, <b class="footsteps">authenticity</b> is analogous to Benjamin's aura. Originality and uniqueness,
																which characterize the auratic work of art in Benjamin, were made into privileged
																			categories in the romantic age <b class="footsteps">that was already flooded</b> <b class="footsteps">by</b> <b class="footsteps">reproductions, translations</b>, and copies of all kinds. Analogously, the ideological value of authenticity
															rose in proportion to print culture's inherent tendency to reproduction <b class="footsteps">and repetition</b>. 
																Even in the <b class="footsteps">transition</b> from a Fordist to a post-Fordist mode of production,
							we can detect <b class="footsteps">the attempt to return</b> the semblance of authenticity and uniqueness
							to commodities by way of customization. Aura and authenticity are analogous to
each other. Both have to be framed historically rather than ontologically. Modernist
decisionism declared both of them dead and gone, <b class="footsteps">but both have proven to be quite</b>
					<b class="footsteps">resistant </b>to all manner of ideology critique. <b class="footsteps">The desire for</b> the auratic and the
					authentic has always reflected the fear of inauthenticity, the lack of existential
					meaning, and the absence of individual originality. The more we learn to understand
					all images, words, and sounds as always already mediated, the more, it seems, we
								desire the authentic and <b class="footsteps">the immediate</b>. The mode of that desire is nostalgia. A gap
										opens up between intellectual insight into the obsolescence of the concept and the
										lifeworld's desire for the authentic. The longing for authenticity is the media and
								commodity culture's romantic longing for its other. Reality TV is its pathetic expres
										sion. Authentic cuisine, authentic clothing, authentic identities of any and all
														kinds follow suit. <b class="footsteps">The positing of stable origins</b> and of a historical telos is never far
														<b class="footsteps">when</b> <b class="footsteps">the</b> authenticity <b class="footsteps">tune is being played</b>. The same is true for the <b class="footsteps">discourse of</b>
												<b class="footsteps">ruins</b> that has played such a central role in legitimizing the claims to power by
															modern nation states.
																		Indeed, romantic ruins guaranteed origins and promised authenticity, immedi
																			acy, and authority. However, there is a paradox. In the case of ruins that which is
																					allegedly present and transparent whenever authenticity is claimed is <b class="footsteps">present only</b>
																					<b class="footsteps">as an absence</b>; it is the imagined present of a past that can now only be grasped in
																					its decay. This makes the ruin subject to nostalgia. Even if the modern ruin is not
																		<b class="footsteps">exhausted</b> by the semantics of pastness, its temporality, which points to past glory
															and greatness, is different from <b class="footsteps">the claims to plenitude and presentness</b> invariably
															at stake in the discourse of authenticity. Authenticity claims, however, are often
														<b class="footsteps">contaminated by doubts</b> that then have to be compensated by further mythmaking.
								Thus some would claim that authentic authenticity was <b class="footsteps">possible only in past ages</b>
					<b class="footsteps">when the world was allegedly still more transparent</b> and not under the shadow of
mass-media representation and distortion. We know what kind of ideological
<b class="footsteps">phantasms such projections</b> of authenticity have caused in anthropology and other
cultural sciences-the authenticity of the archaic and primitive, the privileging of
authentic community, the <b class="footsteps">anomie</b> and artificiality of modern societies. Especially
					in the post-Enlightenment <b class="footsteps">invention of origins</b> and national identities, <b class="footsteps">the present</b>
					of modernity <b class="footsteps">appeared</b> (more often than not) <b class="footsteps">as a ruin</b> of authenticity and of a
							better and simpler past. Against this idea of a deep authenticity embodied in the
								ruins of a glorified past, I posit the idea of the authentic ruin as product of moder
													nity itself rather than as royal road toward some uncontaminated origin.
										Nostalgia is never far when we talk about authenticity or about romantic ruins.
										The political critique of the nostalgia for ruins simply as regression corresponds
										to the philosophical critique of authenticity as a phantasm grounding stable iden
													tities. But such a critique misses the fundamental ambiguity of the ruin, of nostal
																gia, and of the authentic. However justified it may be to criticize the nostalgia
																markets and their ideological <b class="footsteps">instrumentalization</b> of authenticity claims, it will not
											do to simply <b class="footsteps">identify the desire</b> for authenticity with nostalgia and to <b class="footsteps">dismiss it as</b>
											<b class="footsteps">a cultural disease</b>, as Susan Stewart argues in her book On Longing.9 Neither will it

												<b class="footsteps">imperial hubris</b>, and <b class="footsteps">the remembrance of</b> nature in all culture.
												At stake with the "authentic ruin of modernity" is not simply the genuineness
												(Echtheit) of specific ruins; nor is it some suprahistorical memento mori. Genuine
																	ness as naturalness in opposition to <b class="footsteps">artificiality</b> and the fake-a topos central to
																	eighteenth-century aesthetics and middle class culture-is an empirically verifiable
																	criterion of the ruin, and the memento mori dimension is not limited to modernity.
																				We can speak of the modern authenticity of ruins only if we look at the ruin aesthetically and
																				politically as an architectonic chiffre for <b class="footsteps">the temporal and spatial</b>
														<b class="footsteps">doubts</b> that modernity has always <b class="footsteps">harbored</b> about itself. In the ruin, history
														appears spatialized and built space temporalized. An imaginary of ruins is central
											for any theory of modernity that wants to be more than the triumphalism of progress
									and democratization or longing for a past power of greatness. As against the opti
						mism of Enlightenment thought, the modern imaginary of ruins remains conscious
						of the dark side of modernity, that which Diderot described as the inevitable "dev
						astations of time" visible in ruins. It articulates <b class="footsteps">the nightmare of</b> the Enlightenment
that all history might ultimately be overwhelmed by nature, a fear succinctly
represented in Goya's famous etching El sueino de la razon produce monstruos.
				Giovanni Battista Piranesi
				The ambiguity of Goya's title is well-known. "El suefio de la razon" means both the
				dream and <b class="footsteps">the sleep of reason</b>, thus pointing to what later came to be known as the
								dialectic of the Enlightenment. A third reading is possible, however. <b class="footsteps">Imagine</b> that
								the figure, dreaming or having fallen asleep at his table upon which we see the
								utensils of his writing, is the artist imagining the other of reason, imagining that
								which will become the etching-its swarm of owl
													like, nefarious monsters crowding his imagination.
							Assume Goya's figure is <b class="footsteps">Piranesi</b> <b class="footsteps">at the moment of</b>
						<b class="footsteps">dreaming</b> the shape of ruins as they will come alive
				Huyssen I Nostalgia for Ruins 13
						in his etchings. Putting the emphasis on sueno as fantasy and representation rather
				than simply sleep or utopian <b class="footsteps">anticipation permits</b> a reading of Piranesi as the cre
				ator of an authentic imaginary of ruins that reveals something central to modernity
and its representations.
			Piranesi's etchings from the middle of the age of Enlightenment point toward a
		critical and alternative understanding of modernity that always stood against the
	naive belief in progress and the moral improvement of mankind. Although
	Piranesi's nightmarish image world had a strong influence on romantic literature,
		romantic images of ruins in the nineteenth century mostly tended toward domes
					ticating and beautifying ruins by way of the picturesque. It is no coincidence that
					Piranesi's work was emphatically rediscovered in the twentieth century, often in
						the context of <b class="footsteps">reductively realistic</b> claims that his Carceri anticipated the univers
								concentrationnaire of fascism or Communism's gulag or that his etchings articu
									lated the <b class="footsteps">existential exposure</b> and <b class="footsteps">cast-out</b> state of the modern individual in the
									<b class="footsteps">face of overwhelming systems</b> as described in Kafka's novels. Ignored by such read
									ings was the inner connection between Piranesi's <b class="footsteps">fantasies of incarceration</b> and
						the <b class="footsteps">major part</b> of his work: his archival documentation of <b class="footsteps">the architectural ruins of</b>
				<b class="footsteps">the Roman Empire</b>. Art historians tended to read the Carceri <b class="footsteps">as the bizarre work</b> of the
				artist as a young man, while focusing on Piranesi's role in the eighteenth-century
				quarrel over whether the architecture of Athens or that of Rome should have pride
of place. This question was surely central to Piranesi's <b class="footsteps">archival</b> work in and around
Rome, but exclusive focus on this debate does not <b class="footsteps">pay tribute to the</b> fact that the
various <b class="footsteps">reworking</b>s of <b class="footsteps">the Carceri</b> spanned most of Piranesi's working life. It also
						fails <b class="footsteps">to make</b> much of the fact that the later versions of the Carceri are visually close
						to the etchings of Roman ruins. With <b class="footsteps">the</b> help of an alternative body of Piranesi
						scholarship, especially the work of Ulya Vogt-Goknil, Piranesi's <b class="footsteps">imaginary</b> of ruins
						can be adequately understood only if his archive-driven etchings of Roman ruins
										are read together with the fantasy-driven spaces of his architecture of incarceration.
										Only then can one speak of an authentic imaginary of ruins in a precise historical
																sense. Piranesi's ruins and his jails are <b class="footsteps">artifice through and through</b>. That is what
												constitutes their authenticity within his rather dark vision of a modernity still
												much in the shadows of a glorious Roman past. It is an authenticity that is captured
												by Adorno: "The proof of the tour de force, <b class="footsteps">the realization of the unrealizable</b>, could
														be adduced from the most
														authentic works."'0 What
															else are the Carceri if not
														unrealizable as architecture

and tour de force as drawing? For Piranesi and for Adorno, who never wrote about
					this Italian artist, <b class="footsteps">the refusal of wholeness</b> and classical closure is the sign of
					authenticity. Authentic ruins in Piranesi and authentic artworks in Adorno point to
					<b class="footsteps">an absence</b>, the utopia that cannot be named in Adorno, the nightmarish dystopia
					that is inscribed into the utopia of neoclassicism in Piranesi. The tour de force in
					Piranesi's craft points to that moment of coercion and violence implicit in all
					authenticity as carrier of authority. Authentic works for Adorno are fragmentary
										works whose achievement must be located in their lack of completion and whose
										"failure [is] the measure of their success,"" works such as those by Lenz, Holderlin,
														Kleist, or Buchner "that succumbed to the terror of idealism's scorn."'2 At first <b class="footsteps">pop</b>
														ular in France and England, Piranesi's etchings, both of the Carceri and of the
														antique ruins, eventually suffered a similar fate and fell into oblivion only to be
																		rediscovered after World War II. For the nineteenth-century ideologues of the
																		classical tradition they were not reconcilable with a post-Winkelmannian idea
																					of classicism, and they didn't allow for Matthew Arnold's vision of antiquity as
																								<b class="footsteps">sweetness and light</b>.
																								The height of <b class="footsteps">authentic</b> architecture for Piranesi
																		was the monumental Roman temples, palaces, tri
																		umphal archs, and tombs of the Via Appia. In his
													many volumes of etchings, from the Prima Parte di
								Architetture, e Prospettive (1743) and the Varie Vedute
							di Roma (1743) to the four volumes of Le Antichita
					Romane (1756) and Della Magnificenza ed Architettura
					de' Romani (1761), he captured their overgrown
					<b class="footsteps">residues</b> with archival precision and in a decidedly
			unique style. <b class="footsteps">Even in decay</b>, the monumentality and
sublimity of these ruins of the past were more
impressive than the miserable present that denied
the trained architect Piranesi any real possibility to
build in grand style. Piranesi mobilized all available
visual tricks to achieve the monumental mise en scene
			of those ruins. In the dedication to Prima Parte di
					Architetture of 1743 he writes, "To vi dir6 solamente,
					che di tali immagini mi hanno riempiuto lo spirito
					queste parlanti ruine, che di simili non arrivai a poter
											mene mai formare sopra i disegni, benche accuratissimi, che di queste stesse ha
															fatto l'immortale Palladio, e che io pur sempre mi teneva innanzi agli occhi." [I would
																		only say that these speaking ruins have filled my spirit with images of a kind which
																		even precise drawings such as those by the immortal Palladio, which I always kept
																											before my eyes, can never conjure up.]13
																							At stake here is the subjective effect achieved by the representation, <b class="footsteps">the production of</b>
																							
																								 <b class="footsteps">phantasms </b> that the ruins bring to life. Speaking ruins <b class="footsteps">flood the senses</b>
																				with architectonic images that include not only the views of antique Rome but also
																												the Carceri. Especially in their second, significantly darker version, the Carceri
																						show close affinities with the etchings of antique ruins. In their spatial configura
																						tion, the Carceri belong with Piranesi's imagined antiquity rather than with the
																			concentration camps of the twentieth century or the panoptic jails of modern
															industrial societies. Roman architectural elements such as arcades of columns,
									broad flights of stairs, large portrait busts, tomb sculptures, and Latin inscriptions
									fill Piranesi's vast jails down to their distant corners. In their style of representa
					tion, however, the Carceri as well as the overgrown ruins of Rome itself belong
								with a present-day modernity, and not just that of the eighteenth century.
																Despite all affinities, Piranesi's views of Roman ruins are ultimately distin
											guished from the prison etchings and stand in productive tension with them. The
											ruins are located <b class="footsteps">in</b> an outside, in the urban landscape of Rome and its environs,
														the Campagna. Their <b class="footsteps">erosion and natural decay</b> point to that central aspect of the
																	imaginary of ruins that Georg Simmel has emphasized best: the return of architec
																	ture to nature.
						What appears all too romantically as a reconciliation of spirit and nature in
				Simmel, however, assumes features of the uncanny in Piranesi. Masonry and soil
				are <b class="footsteps">organically coupled</b> and made to look <b class="footsteps">as if the ruins have grown out</b> <b class="footsteps">of the</b>
									<b class="footsteps">innards of the earth</b>. In their erosion, some of the buildings appear like sublimely
														threatening and inhospitable rock formations. Mysteriously and uncannily these
																		eroding and decaying monuments and remnants of gigantic buildings tower over
																						a dwarflike present. The voices of <b class="footsteps">the dead</b> appear to <b class="footsteps">speak through </b> Piranesi's ruin
																						images. Instead of nature morte, Piranesi created an architettura morta, which not
																		only reminds <b class="footsteps">the present </b> of its own transitoriness but seems to include a warning
														about a culturally destructive forgetting of the past. While his etchings of antique
												<b class="footsteps">remnants</b> focus on the intertwining <b class="footsteps">of</b> nature and architecture in decay, the Carceri
										present, as it were, <b class="footsteps">pure architectural spaces</b> far from all nature, complex interior
									halls that seem to be partly ruins, <b class="footsteps">partly unfinished</b> buildings.
					This impression is <b class="footsteps">exacerbated</b> by the fact that spatial constriction typical of any
					prison is not constituted by the absence of space but paradoxically by an opening
									up of space toward infinity.14 Passages, staircases, and halls seem to disperse in all
									directions and <b class="footsteps">lack</b> spatial closure. The possibility of an outside (even when not
									represented) is therefore not in principle excluded. Certainly, the natural light stream
									ing into the prisons points indirectly to some
																	outside space. The Carceri are so fascinating
																		because both their temporality and their spa
																		tiality remain so indefinable. Just as the opposi
													tion of proximity and distance seems abolished
													in their confusing spatial arrangements, the bor
																		ders between <b class="footsteps">past, present, and future no longer</b>
																		seem to obtain. Even though Piranesi was influ
																		enced by baroque theater decorations for prison
																	dramas, his mise-en-scene of the prisons has to
							be <b class="footsteps">read</b> primarily as a formal architectonic propo
									sition rather than as a simple message about the
										condition humaine. Bruno Reudenbach put it
													well when he wrote, "We see illogical spatial
													structures not because the goal is to represent
							prisons. On the contrary, building on an already
							developed <b class="footsteps">iconography of prisons</b>, the Carceri
				represent experimental space."15 Piranesi was
interested in prisons <b class="footsteps">as a model</b> for a vast interior
space whose representation allows the artist's
architectonic <b class="footsteps">fantasy</b> to take off independent <b class="footsteps">of</b>
				any <b class="footsteps">realistic limitations</b>. As he had done in some of
				the architectonic fantasies of
								the Prima Parte, Piranesi can
								celed <b class="footsteps">the laws</b> of Euclidean

													space. Units of built space are connected atectonically and illogically. Any single
																	etching requires several distinct <b class="footsteps">perspectives</b> so that the gaze of the spectator never
																	comes to rest. The closer the spectator looks, the more his or her gaze is disturbed.
																	In a detailed analysis of the architectural structure of the Carceri, Ulya Vogt-Goknil
																				has shown how three-dimensional spaces <b class="footsteps">evolve</b> into two-dimensional planes,
																				how <b class="footsteps">depth dimensions</b> are being <b class="footsteps">pulled apart</b> and breadth dimensions are being
																shrunk.16 Especially uncanny is the relationship between space and a kind of light
																				that seems to produce darkness. <b class="footsteps">Rays of light leave their natural trajectory.</b> They
													bend and curve around things, <b class="footsteps">sliding from one object to another</b>, occasionally
									<b class="footsteps">jumping over</b> interstitial spaces. In all these instances, the walls seem to be sucking
									up the light instead of reflecting it. The rules of tectonics and <b class="footsteps">central perspective</b>
	are canceled. Horace Walpole noted of Piranesi: "He has imagined <b class="footsteps">scenes</b> that
would <b class="footsteps">startle</b> geometry."17 And Goethe in his Italienische Reise emphasized the dif
ference between his perception of <b class="footsteps">real</b> ruins and Piranesi's attempt to create effects
<b class="footsteps">through fabulation</b>.18
Contrary to certain claims, such observations must not be attributed to some
							inability or to <b class="footsteps">simple playfulness</b> on Piranesi's part. Piranesi <b class="footsteps">refused</b> to represent
								homogeneous enlightened space in which <b class="footsteps">above and below, inside and outside </b>
												could be clearly distinguished. Instead he privileged arches and bridges, ladders
												and staircases, anterooms and passageways. While massive and <b class="footsteps">static in their</b>
																		encasings, the prisons do suggest motion and transition, a back and forth, up and
																		down that disturbs and unmoors the gaze of the spectator. Instead of viewing lim
																			ited spaces from a fixed-observer perspective and from a safe distance, the specta
																				tor is drawn into a <b class="footsteps">proliferating</b> labyrinth of staircases, bridges, and passageways
																					that seem to lead into infinite depths left, right, and center<b class="footsteps">.</b> <b class="footsteps">It is as if</b> the spectator's
																					gaze is imprisoned by the represented space, <b class="footsteps">lured in</b> and captured because no
																								firm point of view can be had as the eye wanders around in <b class="footsteps">this labyrinth</b>. Contrary
																							to what Alexander Kupfer claims, this does not suggest that <b class="footsteps">space and time lose all
																					meaning</b>.19 The lack of central perspective and a firm point of view, <b class="footsteps">the proliferation of perspectives</b> and 
																							<b class="footsteps">unfolding</b> of <b class="footsteps">spaces</b> must be read differently: Piranesi
																followed to their logical conclusion the spatialization of history and the temporal
																ization of space that already characterized his etchings of antiquities. In his Carceri
													d'invenzione-the modifying noun is significant-times and spaces are shoved
															into each other, telescoped and superimposed as if <b class="footsteps">in a palimpsest</b> whereby this
												complex temporally fraying imagination of space becomes <b class="footsteps">itself a prison</b> of inven
												tion. Tour de force, as Adorno says of what are to him the most authentic works of art.
									Manfredo Tafuri has argued that by breaking with the temporal and spatial
									perspectivalism of the Renaissance, the Carceri d'invenzione already point toward
									basic principles <b class="footsteps">of construction</b> as developed much later by the cubists, construc
											tivists, and surrealists.20 Equally important, however, is <b class="footsteps">a fundamental difference</b>
									between Piranesi and the historical avant-garde. Piranesi's imagination is not ener
									gized by some constructive utopian <b class="footsteps">ideal</b> of multiperspectivalism and spatial flu
												idity (Eisenstein); nor does he privilege montage or the fragment in the same way.
							He rather remains <b class="footsteps">haunted</b> by the threatening aura of ruins, by their oppressive
			<b class="footsteps">interlocking of past and present</b>, nature and culture, death and life. The work
undermines any enlightened and secure standpoint in the course of time and in
				the location in space, and it is quite <b class="footsteps">distant from</b> the avant-garde's ethos of alter
				native futures. Ultimately, Piranesi's prisons are also ruins, more authentic even
		than the Roman ruins of the Vedute di Roma. The <b class="footsteps">irritating</b> and <b class="footsteps">threatening</b> simul
	taneity of times and spaces, of condensed and displaced perspectives, which is
		exacerbated in the second version of the prison etchings by the increased presence
			of torture instruments, pushes the impression of <b class="footsteps">uncanny</b> space to an extreme only
				in the Carceri.
									Conclusion
				<b class="footsteps">In their reciprocal tension</b> and <b class="footsteps">their obsessive intermingling</b> of times and spaces,
									Piranesi's prisons and ruins can be read as <b class="footsteps">allegories</b> of a modernity whose utopia
												of freedom and progress, linear time and geometric space they not only question
												but cancel out. <b class="footsteps">A past embodied in ruined</b> and memory-laden architecture seems
												to <b class="footsteps">tower</b> over the present of the age of Enlightenment. Piranesi's imaginary of ruins
															is thus <b class="footsteps">the product</b> of an age that only slowly freed itself from the overwhelming
												ideal of classical antiquity. <b class="footsteps">In its decay</b>, antique architecture <b class="footsteps">articulates that</b> dialec
												tical <b class="footsteps">constellation</b> of nature and history that posits the changeability and contin
										gency of both nature and history instead of <b class="footsteps">opposing</b> blind mythological nature
							to history as enlightened ontological agency. Piranesi's work <b class="footsteps">thus belongs</b> with a							self-critical consciousness that has accompanied enlightened <b class="footsteps">modernity from its</b>
							<b class="footsteps">beginning.</b> The authenticity of Piranesi's imaginary of ruins lies in this critical aes
		thetic consciousness and its articulation in <b class="footsteps">terrifyingly beautiful</b> etchings. If the
	etchings of <b class="footsteps">decaying</b> classical architecture point to a <b class="footsteps">natural history</b> of <b class="footsteps">destruction</b>
				in a Sebaldian mode, then the Carceri suggest a cultural history of incarceration in
				<b class="footsteps">an infinite inner space</b> that no longer has any outside-a critique of Romanticism
avant la lettre.
Reading Piranesi through Adorno and <b class="footsteps">through</b> Benjamin's concept of natural
history, which is grounded in a philosophy of history, will also reveal the historical
limits of <b class="footsteps">this authentic imaginary</b> of ruins. <b class="footsteps">As a form</b> of secularized theology with
its rises and falls, <b class="footsteps">declines and redemptions</b> of cultures, the philosophy of history
											produced by the Enlightenment <b class="footsteps">stands</b> itself <b class="footsteps">like a ruin</b> in our twenty-first-century
															present. <b class="footsteps">Analogously</b>, Piranesi's <b class="footsteps">imaginary</b> of ruins has itself become a ruin.
															Modernist architecture points to another <b class="footsteps">historical boundary</b> of an imaginary of
																		ruins 'a la Piranesi. <b class="footsteps">Concrete, steel, and glass</b> building materials aren't <b class="footsteps">subject</b> to
																		erosion and decay the way stone is. Modernist architecture <b class="footsteps">refuses</b> the return of
																				culture to <b class="footsteps">nature</b>. Furthermore, <b class="footsteps">the real</b> catastrophes of the twentieth century have
																				mainly <b class="footsteps">left rubble</b> rather <b class="footsteps">than</b> ruins in Piranesi's <b class="footsteps">sense</b>, even if some of that rubble
															has lent itself quite well <b class="footsteps">to beautifying</b> representations. The age of the "authentic
											ruin," at any rate, is over; its genealogy can be written, but it cannot be resurrected.
											The present is <b class="footsteps">an age of preservation</b>, restoration, and authentic remakes, all of
													which cancel out the idea of the authentic ruin that has itself become historical.
		But Piranesi's ruins are accessible to <b class="footsteps">reflective</b> nostalgia. They embody a <b class="footsteps">dialectic</b>
of modernity that should be <b class="footsteps">remembered</b> as we try to imagine <b class="footsteps">a future</b> beyond the
false promises <b class="footsteps">of</b> corporate neoliberalism and <b class="footsteps">the globalized shopping mall</b>. The
future, not just of nostalgia, is <b class="footsteps">at stake</b>.

Giovanni Battista Piranesi <b class="footsteps">was</b> <b class="footsteps">born</b> in Mogliano near Treviso <b class="footsteps">in 1720</b> and died in
						Rome in 1778. <b class="footsteps">Son</b> of a Venetian stonemason, <b class="footsteps">his first</b> teacher was an uncle, Matteo
											Lucchesi, who taught him <b class="footsteps">to draw</b> and <b class="footsteps">design</b> architectural structures as well as
																<b class="footsteps">theatrical sets</b>. His uncle also imparted an <b class="footsteps">appreciation</b> of Palladium’s work. In 1740
																he <b class="footsteps">left</b> for Rome <b class="footsteps">where</b> he remained almost all his life. He became a draftsman in
																<b class="footsteps">the entourage</b> of the Venetian ambassador Marco Foscarini, but the city itself offered
											him the opportunity of <b class="footsteps">developing</b> an interest in classical antiquities. In these years
in Rome, he also studied <b class="footsteps">perspective</b> and <b class="footsteps">stage design</b> under Giuseppe Valeriani,
									and <b class="footsteps">engraving</b> under Giuseppe Vasi.
									He returned to Venice briefly in 1744, <b class="footsteps">hoping</b> <b class="footsteps">to establish</b> a career as an architect
																			but failed and returned to Rome in 1747, setting up as an engraver and print
																						publisher and finding an immediate outlet for his talent. Eighteenth century Rome
																													had become one of the main destinations for visitors on <b class="footsteps">the Grand Tour</b> of Europe;
																									souvenirs most appreciated were <b class="footsteps">the vedute (topographical views)</b> and capricci
																						(imaginative compositions, a Venetian tradition). <b class="footsteps">Seizing</b> the moment, Piranesi
																										opened a gallery for the sale of prints — chiefly his own — of his etchings of
																			poetic ruins and <b class="footsteps">of</b> Renaissance Rome. <b class="footsteps">The</b> international reputation he had gained
																			grew rapidly.
																			Over his career he produced around 1000 etchings. There were three <b class="footsteps">main series</b>:
																			Vedute di Roma (Views of Rome); Antichità Romane (Roman Antiquities); and the
																			Carceri d’Invenzione (Imaginary Prisons), <b class="footsteps">this last</b> a group of 16 etchings. A first
																			set of 14 plates of capricci (Invenzioni capric(ciose) de Carceri) were published
															during his first stay in Rome.
In a republishing in 1761, all the etchings <b class="footsteps">were reworked</b> <b class="footsteps">and</b> two new ones <b class="footsteps">added</b>.
					In this second edition, Piranesi heightens the <b class="footsteps">dark/light</b> contrasts in an architecture
															of increasing complexity.

													REACTIONS TO PIRANESI BY THE LITERARY WORLD
													The imaginary <b class="footsteps">interiors</b> of Piranesi had a profound effect not only on <b class="footsteps">stage</b>
																		designers, but also in literature, as clearly demonstrated by <b class="footsteps">eminent</b> writers such
											as Goethe, Stendal, Byron, Coleridge, De Quincey, Canetti, Huxley, Yourcenar,
											who made significant commentaries. I have chosen <b class="footsteps">extracts</b> from two essays —
							Piranesi and the infinite prisons 7
						written six decades apart — that demonstrate the persisting <b class="footsteps">interest</b> in Piranesi and
his continued relevance.
(i) Prisons by Aldous Huxley. This essay originally formed an introduction to a
1949 edition of Piranesi’s famous etchings.
			All the plates in the series are self-evidently <b class="footsteps">variations</b> on a single symbol,
			whose reference is to things existing in the physical and metaphysical depths
											of human souls — to acedia and confusion, to nightmare and angst, to
											incomprehension and a panic bewilderment. The most disquietingly obvious
																			feel that the genius of great artists and the labour of innumerable slaves have
													gone into the creation of these monuments, every detail of which is completely
																			without a purpose. Yes, without a purpose: for the staircases lead nowhere, the
																			vaults support nothing but their own weight and enclose vast spaces that are
																			never truly rooms, but only ante-rooms, lumber-rooms, vestibules, outhouses.
																And this magnificence of Cyclopean stone is everywhere made squalid by
					fact about all these dungeons is the perfect pointlessness which reigns
											throughout. Their architecture is colossal and magnificent. One is made to
								wooden ladders, by flimsy gangways and cat-walks. And the squalor is for
								squalor’s sake, since all these rickety roads through space are manifestly
								without destination. Below them, on the floor, stand great machines incapable
								of doing anything in particular, and from the arches overhead hang ropes that
carry nothing except a sickening suggestion of torture. Some of the Prisons are
			lighted only by narrow windows. Others are half open to the sky, with hints
			of yet other vaults and walls in the distance. But even where the enclosure
						is more or less complete, Piranesi always contrives to give the impression
																						that this colossal pointlessness goes on indefinitely, and is co-extensive with
																						the universe. Engaged in no recognisable activity, paying no attention to one
																			another, a few small, faceless figures haunt the shadows. Their insignificant
																			presence merely emphasises the fact that there is nobody at home.
																						. . .
																						Considered from a purely formal standpoint, the Prisons are remarkable
																			as being the nearest eighteenth century approach to abstract art. The raw
																			material of Piranesi’s designs consists of architectural forms; but, because
														the Prisons are images of confusion, because their essence is pointlessness,
																		the combination of architectural forms never adds up to an architectural
																		drawing, but remains a free design, untrammelled by any considerations of
																				utility or even possibility, and limited only by the necessity of evoking the
																						general idea of a building. In other words, Piranesi uses architectural forms
																						to produce a series of beautifully intricate designs — designs which resemble
																						the abstractions of the Cubists in being composed of geometrical elements, but
						which have the advantage of combining pure geometry with enough subject
						matter, enough literature, to express more forcibly than a mere pattern can do,
						the obscure and terrible states of spiritual confusion and acedia.

The underground world of Imaginary Prisons is dramatic, but it is an ominous
					spectacle. In these enormous rooms, it’s hard to find a stable place to orient
					ourselves. We are overpowered by gigantic structures, but we can neither trace
					their foundations nor figure out their functions. Cables and stairways slash
											through the sky, but it’s difficult to say where they are going or why. If we
											move our eyes only slightly, we are forced to shift our perspective radically,
											and we may find it hard to shift back. All the visual elements of this world
					seem to clash and contradict. This must be the purest “negative space” ever
									envisioned. The light is weird: how can such vast darkness yield such clear,
									precise images of details?. . . The way structures are layered, cross-hatched,
													and intertwined in this underground world, the way light flashes from above
													only to be swallowed up by the darkness again (this is especially true in the
													1761 second-state engravings), the absence of entrances or exits, the way the
									heaviest piers are piled on each other and seem to press us down — all this
													gives this place an aura of disaster about to happen. Any minute, it seems, the
								whole world could crash. . . Piranesi seems to gather up all the forms that men
								have created to break out of Plato’s cave, but he then puts them together in
				such a way that we seem to be trapped in that cave more deeply than ever.
And yet, somehow, those of us who love Imaginary Prisons don’t feel trapped.
Instead, we experience this work as a parable of rising, of striving, of
overcoming, of breaking out of the cave and into the sunlight.
			ARCHITECTURAL ATTRIBUTES OF PIRANESI’S WORK
			The work of Piranesi has been subject of deep enquiry by specialists in history
			of art and architecture (Tafuri, 1980; Wilton-Ely, 1978). Very recently, Kantor-
							Kazovsky (2006) published an extensive analysis of the whole body of Piranesi’s
							work, and to her I am indebted for the main suggestion to analyse in perceptual
				terms the 16 Carceri. In the analysis of Prima Parte di Architetture e Prospettive
							she claims: “Piranesi uses the principle of repetition of forms, sometimes rather
							monotonous. While Juvarra’s aim was to combine many motifs in one frame,
							Piranesi concentrates on a single simple colonnade, pier or arch. His chosen motif
				may be isolated or repeated several times in depth or in width. A slow development
												and display of similar forms, mostly on a horizontal or slightly diagonal plane,
												allows the viewer to get a full idea of individual elements and the ways of their
															combination” (pp. 184–185).
															In Piranesi’s etchings, a fantastic architecture combines naves, beams, arches,
															towers, halls to create an environment that stirs up a rich array of impressions and
											emotions. Exploration of some of the numerous web pages dedicated to the Carceri
											allow many of these comments to be gathered and classified. The most frequent
											attributes are the following:
											(A) Depth or abyss (“dungeons, with us at the bottom, like inmates of hell’s deep-
				est level”, “underground world, enormous subterranean world”, “structures
layered, cross-hatched, and intertwined in this underground world”).
Piranesi and the infinite prisons 9
(B) Pointlessness (“galleries, ladders, bridges leading nowhere, endless, to dead-
ends”, “the perfect pointlessness, emptiness of purpose”, “insignificant bridges
nonetheless, trapped for eternity”, “ interlocking mysterious compositions (flat
				planes, deep diagonals), “endless stone stairways and arches”, “untraceable
								foundations, inexplicable functions”, “bridges to nowhere extending to one
								side of the structure to the next, but leading only to dead ends not doorways”,
				“bizarre galleries leading nowhere”).
				(C) Cyclopic architecture (“architecture is colossal and magnificent”, “Massive
				architectural forms loom above darkly shadowed spaces”, “the immensity
									of the architecture seems to embody the workings of a great supernatural
									power”, “combining these imaginary buildings together as closely as possible,
													alternations of scale and juxtaposition of elements enhance the sense of
																grandeur”, “immense gloomy arcades” , “invention of extraordinarily spacious
																buildings such as baths, amphitheatres”).
																(D) Voids (“immense arcades”, “vastness”, “vast spaces”, “opening up of space
																towards infinity”).
																(E) Vertiginous walkways (“cavernous spaces traversed by vertiginous walk-
																ways”, “staircases rising to incredible heights”, “wooden ladders, vertiginous
													walkways”, “stairways lead nowhere”).
									(F) Dark and shadow contrasts (“dramatic contrasts between lit spaces and deep
													shadows”, “dark and shadowy prison with no exit”).
													(G) Horror (“sinister and fantastic views of imaginary prisons”, “awful horror
													suggested by sinister machinery of cables, pulleys, and levers”, “cosmos of
									terror and disintegration”, “iron rings”).
				(H) Recession ad infinitum (“colossal pointlessness continuing indefinitely, co-
				extensive with the universe”, “sequences of vaults, arches and stairs receding
				to infinity introduced beyond the arches and bridges by Piranesi”, “spectators
				drawn into proliferating labyrinths of staircases, bridges, and passageways
that seem to lead into infinite depths left, right, and centre”).
(I) Insignificant people (“diminutive figures seemingly doomed to climb endless
					staircases without hope of arrival; human figures barely noticeable, tiny
							humans travel these stairs”).
							(L) Confinement (“absence of entrances or exits”, “bridges leading to dead-
		ends not doorways”, “fantastic immeasurable dungeons”, “limitlessness as a
		prison, with no escape”).
		(M) Oppression (“apparent pressing down of the heaviest piers, piled on each
					other”, “arches swinging above the observers heads”).
					It is very difficult, perhaps impossible, to find a further example in history of an
					artist whose etchings stirred up such a richness of impressions and such deep and
					complex meanings. The leading motif might be summarised as an organisation
					of underground immense space with pointlessness but whatever the definition, the
					10 S. Roncato
		variety of impressions and phenomenological attributes inherent in the Carceri
		render Piranesi a singular artistic figure indeed.
CUES TO MEANING
So what are the pictorial and architectural cues that produce such a rich set of
meanings? The most frequent attributes cited by Carceri’s art critics are confinement
and immensity. Piranesi represents these two attributes in vedute and in monument
							etchings; the confinement is almost claustrophobic in etchings such as Antichità
							d’Albano (water reservoir), the immensity of vaults is widespread in many etchings
									(Adriano bridge and mausoleum). Etchings and engravings do exist in which
													dreariness and neglect emerge and pervade, but none has been taken as the symbol
												of fear, bewilderment and anxiety that the Carceri have become. Where, then, is
												the source of the meanings? According to some essayists, it is the paradoxical
															simultaneous presence of confinement and immensity that disturbs. The immense
																vaults and naves are perceived as a wide space enveloping itself, a continuous
																experience in which infinity and finiteness alternate and cancel each other out.
															Arcades and vaults are almost ubiquitous in the 16 etchings, but it is difficult
												to assign to these architectural forms — despite their specific representations —
												the source of the attributes. If we look at Raphael’s School of Athens nothing
								analogous to the oppression of Piranesi’s halls can be found in the perspective of
							the vaults; indeed, there is quite the opposite impression, one of openness. The
							weird combination of confinement and immensity itself does not generate anxiety.
In Figs 2 and 3, two examples demonstrate this combination: the immensity of the
spaces and the ‘shell’ that encloses them are both striking: the impressions given
by the vastness of the spaces and of their enclosure are equally powerful, this latter
								heightened by the light that appears or filters through from openings high up. But
						even so, the impact of this impression is very much less than the sense of unease
							and claustrophobia evoked by the Carceri etchings.
									Walls and arches — made up of colossal blocks often arranged irregularly —
											may evoke feelings of being hemmed in, of inescapable barriers. Kantor-Kazowsky
											(2006) claims that the Tuscan way of building fortifications with ‘huge irregular
															blocks of stones’ arises out of a reaction of terror seen in Renaissance architectural
															thought (Leon Battista Alberti). A wall of massive blocks is undoubtedly impressive
															but the sinister spell of the Carceri is so pervasive throughout the 16 etchings that it
											cannot derive from the ‘texture’ of a simple wall.
														Some researchers shift attention from the architectural forms or details them-
														selves, and onto the layout, which has bewildering characteristics. According to
														Huyssens (2006), “Instead of viewing limited spaces from a fixed-observer perspec-
														tive and from a safe distance, the spectator is drawn into a proliferating labyrinth
									of staircases, bridges, and passageways that seem to lead into infinite depths left,
									right, and centre. It is as if the spectator’s gaze is imprisoned by the represented
									Piranesi and the infinite prisons 11

space, lured in and captured because no firm point of view can be had as the eye
wanders around in this labyrinth” (p. 18).
					In the search for a typical feature of Piranesi’s Carceri, we cannot concentrate
					on the labyrinthine layout represented. Some images and representations are
					more labyrinthine than others, and a source of wandering — technical drawings,
																			urban landscapes — but they have not the pregnancy of meaning of the Carceri.
																			Conversely, we may register a sensation of wandering in an environment with quite
																													the opposite characteristics of the Carceri, for example a modern building with glass
																								walls and bright intersecting corridors.
																								The conclusion is that the acute sense of oddity that the Carceri convey has
																								more than one origin. Not only does one perceive a labyrinth, but also a series
																								of dissonances, incongruities, a scene with a fleeting spatial organisation. There
																							are no absolute reference points or directions for ‘inside/outside’, ‘above/below’, so
																						their order reverses as scene inspection proceeds. The axes and directions of spatial
																				organisation are not steady; Piranesi reaches this result principally by violating two
																				main constraints, namely dimensional coherence and the unit of perceived space.
															The complex of these incoherencies is sometimes associated with a perspective
													which views from below, generating a particular sensation of objects floating. Let
												me illustrate this violation of constraints, and the sensation of floating.
											VIOLATION OF CONSTRAINTS
																Dimensional and topological
																Figure 1a (Plate III, ‘The tower’) is a good example of the perceived effects of
																				violation of architectural units proportions.
																				At the bottom of the figure, staircases lead to the base of a bastion; from its
																						top, traversed by a terrace, the arches of a nave lead out. A bastion is in fact
																		part of a fortification that projects outwards from the curtain or wall corner. In
																		the etching, it plays the role of a column that supports arches forming an immense
														nave. The bastion is simultaneously the outer side of part of a building, and the
														static component of an inner space. The ‘exterior’ attribute of the bastion wall is
enhanced by the bridge that joins it through an appropriate wall.
		The various architectural forms we have analysed here — stairs, grating, stones,
		arches, terraces — and the small figures do not have compatible (or consistent)
								dimensions. Note that the bastion has the dimensions of a tower when referred to
								the stairs, but the stones and grating are out of proportion with respect to the steps
								themselves and the figures. At the bastion top, a terrace replaces the capital, again
												larger and out of proportion. The arches departing from the top are as large as the
										terrace.
															What the observer can view resembles the illusory Ames room, where dimen-
															sional incongruences are distributed in both depth and vertical direction.
															Note that three scenes are piled up on top of each other: staircases, bastion,
											arches and naves. They preserve the perceptual sizes they have from different
											Piranesi and the infinite prisons 13
																		distances and are combined ‘pictorially’. The staircases and bridge are drawn as
																		though perceived from further off compared with the bastion, as are the arches. The
																						phenomenological effects are clear: the tower appears magnified. Dürer in his ‘View
															of Arco’ (1495), in which a giant face is carved out in the rock, can be considered
															a precursor of these effects. Vogt-Göknil (1958) has observed that in some plates,
										the dimensional spaces evolve into two-dimensional planes; dimensions of depth
						are pulled apart; and dimensions of breadth are being made to shrink (Escher’s
engravings, Carceri, Plate XIV).
Space fragmentation
What we perceive is the result of a series of processes by which fragments are
								integrated into wholes. Psychologists have singled out and analysed several aspects
								and manifestations of these completion processes, one of the best known being
													amodal completion. These processes are harder to explore when complex visual
													scenes are considered. The Carceri offer a singular chance to examine these
													aspects of visual integration or completion. What we experience is the imagining
								of a fragmented world; what is missing is not the unity of an object, but rather
the unity of space and the coherence of the parts in which it articulates. The
									various architectural elements are pictorially joined with great skill to guarantee
								spatial and constructive continuity. But the final result appears phenomenally odd,
										sometimes at local level, often at global level. A possible source for the perception
													of incongruence at the local level has been considered in the section above on
																incoherence. Here I aim to show how spatial integration can be thwarted, or lead to
														illogical solutions.
													The lack of spatial unity of the Carceri scenarios can be likened to the effect we
															can observe when we reproduce polyhedral shapes on a plane surface. The three
																polygons in Fig. 4a are perceived as a block (parallelepiped) (or more precisely
																			‘interpreted’, since they can as the interior of an open block). If we draw patterns
																						of this type in conjunction with a lateral edge, we produce various different
																						phenomenological outcomes. In Fig. 4b, two blocks contact along an end edge,
																													while in Fig. 4c they have a common side edge. In this latter case, the contemporary
																										presence of the two blocks in the phenomenological world seems incompatible. The
																										drawing appears unstable: if we perceive one parallelepiped, the other disappears
																															and vice versa, and it is certainly impossible to perceive a unitary volume.
																													Over the last century, many artists have dicovered the fascination of the ‘chimeric’
																															shapes produced by particular combinations of surfaces and volumes reproduced in
																										two-dimensional space: shapes that are complete only in part, are unstable, and
																										possess elements that are impossible to fit together to form a real three-dimensional
																						object.
																						These curious effects have been widely illustrated in the drawings of the Swedish
																									painter Reutervärd, then by Dutch engraver M. C., Escher and English mathemati-
																									cian Roger Penrose. In Fig. 4d, three parallelepipeds reproduce the basic pattern
																									14 S. Roncato
																			Figure 4. (a) parallelepiped. (b) and (c): the two volumes have opposite orientation in depth
																			and appear as ‘impossible pairings’. (d) Volumes drawn following the Reutervärd rules, the whole
																		pattern appears as an impossible figure. (e) An impossible figure that is not perceived as such, the
																		impossibility becomes apparent by exploring the block surfaces (f).
																							with which Reutervärd drew the first impossible figures of cubes. If the three paral-
																							lelepipeds are brought together so as to touch, it creates the Penrose triangle.
																							The three shapes in Fig. 4d appear impossible to fit together to form a whole
																							object. The instability of the percept here consists in the impossibility of connecting
																		all the shape at once, since one of the three areas of connection has a block that
					uncouples; if we try perceptually to hook up the ends of the blocks, the couplings
just made vanish, and so on. In this case, the resistance to a perceptual integration of
the three blocks reflects the impossibility of physically (geometrically) connecting
them in the direction illustrated in the drawing. Nevertheless, the physical-
						geometrical constraints do not seem inviolable for the perceptual system. Figure 4e
											illustrates a case of physical impossibility that is not perceived as such, unless the
											observer is required to explore the world defined by the blocks. An observer asked
													to imagine walking along the direction of the arrows in Fig. 4f will notice at the end
																	point that he is close to one extremity of the left-hand vertical parallelepiped but
															above the start point, despite the fact that he was walking on a plane surface.
															In this case, the spatial exploration refutes the phenomenal percept, an event
																	neither rare nor exceptional in daily life or experimental enquiry. The strangeness is
								enhanced when the paradox is made directly visible. Escher illustrated this paradox
								in a startling way in his engravings entitled: Belvedere, Ascending-Descending and
						Waterfall.
						The scenarios created by Escher have spatial arrangements that reproduce the
												basic organisations illustrated in Figs 4c and 4d; their illogicity is made evident by
																images of people walking or climbing and by water-flow from which the observer
																sees that the motion is impossible because the space extension in height and depth
																is illusory, or else through a drawing where distance between surfaces is altered.
																		The space in the Piranesi etchings also presents serious difficulties to an observer
																		who imagines walking within them. An interesting essay by Stoppani (2006) offers
															valuable suggestions for analysing the ‘movement’ in the Carceri (“The nature of
													space is . . . determined by the movement that operates in it”). Nevertheless, the
													reasons for which this space is difficult or impossible to explore are richer and more
													complex than just those taken into consideration in polyhedral volumes.
																			Let me illustrate two conditions of difficulty of local scene integration.
																		In Fig. 5, I have drawn an example of a possible solution to a process aimed
																		at integrating a cube and a staircase. The stairs lead to a level below that of the
																					surface with sides A and B; if the phenomenal field were a reproduction of these
															geometrical indications, we would be induced to perceiving a cube without a base
															and a staircase suspended in empty space. This solution is discarded in favour of
															a perceptually simpler one: the staircase begins at a higher level than A and leads
												down to a solid surface. The solution is illogical, but the visual system prefers it
						because it is ‘less disturbing’ (the viewer has a weak impression of space torsion).
											There can also be volumes that ‘resist’ the process of integration. In Fig. 6, a
											perspective view depicts a space divided into three adjacent cubes; two walls are
											interrupted by corridor openings. At local level, the solutions are easy because
													the depth cues are clear. Globally, the integration of the volumes — of which a
													Figure 5. A staircase suspended in empty space or leading to the A × B floor?
							16 S. Roncato
							Figure 6. Intersecting corridors (see text).
			partial view is drawn — is difficult. Integration can occur along two different spatial
							directions, as indicated by arrows. Along the first, surface completion leads to the
												perception of cubes (or three rooms); in the perpendicular direction, completion
												gives rise to corridors through the rooms. The corridors and rooms are interlaced
												but the solution is not easy to perceive for observers unable to complete the volumes
							of corridor and rooms at the same time. They appear to interfere and cannot be
				integrated into a unitary volume.
							These two examples above illustrate possible sources of difficulty in achieving
											a perception of a whole congruent space in the Piranesi Carceri. Furthermore, it
				should be noted that the scene gives no clear indication of how to explore its spaces;
		rather, it seems to impede exploration or take the explorer off route. The people
				scattered throughout the etchings do not allow the observer to understand where they
							come from, nor do they demonstrate intentionality or destination points. Piranesi
							draws all types of devices — stairs, passages, ropes, chains — inventing connection
									and interlacement of lines, surfaces and volumes, to complicate the perceived space.
										In summary, any attempt to come through the space of the Carceri is frustrated by
												a double failure: impossibility of creating for oneself a plane of exploration, and
															impossibility of inferring, from the motions represented, a direction to proceed or
												even an auxiliary device such as Ariadne’s thread.
																	The Carceri are a collection of challenges for the visual system, which has to
																	solve problems of surface and space completion at different levels. The scenarios
																	are made up of intersecting solid and empty volumes, and concave and convex
												surfaces, in a variety of ways that severely hinder the search for basic patterns of
												spatial incongruity as can be carried out in the Escher engravings.
																The perceptual solution is unsteady and illogical, like an unconvincing solution
																of a problem. Perhaps the true fascination of the Carceri lies in the uncertainty of
																the perceptual results, that is, in the elusiveness of many of its contradictions that
																solicit a continuous revision of the hypothesis of their odd world.
								Piranesi and the infinite prisons 17
																	Figure 7. The same pattern from two different perspectives.
																	Floating patterns
																	In Fig. 7, the same series of parallelepipeds has been reproduced from a top and
											a bottom perspective. Note the difference of phenomenological impression. From
											the top, the complex is steady; viewing from below gives a vivid impression that
											it is floating and dynamic. Massive form, vastness and perspective from below: all
																these attributes contribute to generating a perception of unstable equilibrium, easy to
												disrupt and collapse on the observer. Piranesi uses this device directly by drawing
												suspended wooden passages, but the interlacing arches and bridges viewed from
								below contribute to giving the overall scene the appearance of a floating building.
								The bottom perspective is not Piranesi’s usual point of view, according to Vogt-
							Göknil (cited by Kantor-Kazovsky, 2006): the Carceri represent an exception that
						demonstrates how impressive the objects may become when depicted from this
				unusual direction.
			This brief overview clearly demonstrates that Piranesi’s Carceri constitute very
						suitable material for research into vision and scene perception, providing a unique
opportunity for study. Their variety might indeed form a fertile basis for an all-
								round investigation of the procedures by which the visual system achieves its
						coherent representation of the world in its complex manifestations. Figuratively and
										otherwise, Piranesi certainly challenges us with problem-solving at many levels.
